The iLLM-TSC project was updated to use a local LLaMA 3.1–8B model instead of the OpenAI GPT API. All necessary changes were made in the rl_llm_tsc.py and in tsc_assistant.py to support local usage through Ollama on a MacBook Pro. Now, the traffic light control system runs fully offline without internet or API keys. The research paper related to the project was also included in the repository.
